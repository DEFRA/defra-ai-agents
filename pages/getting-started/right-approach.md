## ðŸ§­ 3. Selecting the Right Approach

### A. Use **AI Agents** When:

- The system needs **goal-directed behaviour**  
  _Example: An AI agent that identifies and responds to invasive species outbreaks in near real-time._

- Decisions depend on **real-time inputs**  
  _Example: An agent that adapts irrigation schedules based on weather, soil, and crop status._

- There is **uncertainty or changing conditions**  
  _Example: A flood-response agent that reacts to sensor data and weather alerts._

- The system should **adapt and learn over time**  
  _Example: A livestock monitoring agent that learns normal vs. abnormal behaviour for early disease detection._

---

### B. Use **AI Workflows** When:

- Tasks are **predictable and repeatable**, but not rule-only  
  _Example: Processing satellite imagery to identify land cover with human verification._

- You need to **orchestrate models or decisions**  
  _Example: Environmental permit processing workflow using ML risk scoring and policy checks._

- Human-in-the-loop is required  
  _Example: Flagging potentially non-compliant fishing reports for review._

- You need full **audit trails and transparency**  
  _Example: Classifying chemical use in farming with documented steps and model outputs._

---

### C. Use **Traditional Automation (RPA)** When:

- The task is **repetitive, rule-based, and low variability**  
  _Example: Extracting water quality readings from spreadsheets and pasting them into a legacy system._

- No AI or learning is required  
  _Example: Transferring inspection results from email attachments into an internal database._

- Interaction with UI-based systems is necessary  
  _Example: A bot that logs into a legacy website and downloads environmental compliance reports daily._

- The aim is to reduce manual data entry or speed up workflows  
  _Example: Auto-filing permit renewals from a fixed template._

---

### D. Use **Multi-Agent Systems** When:

- The problem involves **multiple stakeholders or domains**  
  _Example: Policy simulation with agents representing biodiversity, flood risk, and agricultural productivity._

- Agents must **coordinate or negotiate**  
  _Example: Coordinated response by different agents to wildfire outbreaks across regions._

- Roles require **independent behaviours or goals**  
  _Example: One agent forecasts pollution spread, another plans cleanup, and another communicates with responders._
