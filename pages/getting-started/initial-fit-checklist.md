## ‚úÖ 2. Initial Fit Checklist


Before investing in AI, RPA, or multi-agent systems, use this checklist to assess what kind of solution is best suited to your use case.

### ‚úÖ Checklist Questions

| Question | Explanation | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Does the task require autonomous decision-making?** | The system needs to make decisions or take actions based on defined goals, without a human directly triggering every step. | _An agent that detects rising river levels and activates flood barriers autonomously._ |
| **2. Is the environment dynamic or context-dependent?** | The data or situation changes frequently and unpredictably, requiring the system to adapt in real time. | _Crop monitoring with weather-dependent decisions that must adjust daily._ |
| **3. Is the task highly repetitive and rule-based?** | The task is predictable, follows a clear set of rules, and doesn't require human judgement or learning. | _Copying data from a PDF permit form into a legacy reporting system._ |
| **4. Will the system need to coordinate between multiple roles, systems, or objectives?** | Multiple agents, services, or stakeholders need to collaborate, negotiate, or simulate their behaviour. | _A land-use model balancing conservation, agriculture, and flood mitigation priorities._ |
| **5. Is interpretability or auditability required for decision-making?** | The decisions must be explainable and traceable for legal, ethical, or public accountability reasons. | _A workflow recommending pesticide use must log reasoning and model inputs for audit._ |

### üîç Interpretation Guide

Use your answers to guide the recommended type of system:

| If... | Then consider... |
|-------|------------------|
| ‚úÖ Mostly Yes to Q1 and Q2 | **AI Agent** ‚Äì because the system needs autonomy and adaptability. |
| ‚úÖ Mostly Yes to Q3 | **Traditional Automation (RPA)** ‚Äì as it's a clear, repeatable task with no need for intelligence. |
| ‚úÖ Yes to Q4 | **Multi-Agent System** ‚Äì coordination or simulation across roles is needed. |
| ‚úÖ Yes to Q5 and the process uses AI models or human reviews | **AI Workflow** ‚Äì traceable steps and oversight are critical. |

### üß† Tips

- If your task is mostly static and structured, start with RPA or an AI Workflow before exploring full AI Agents.
- Multi-Agent Systems should only be considered when there‚Äôs real complexity in coordination or simulation.
- AI Workflows are especially valuable when models and rules need to work together in a controlled, auditable process.
- AI Agents add value where automation must respond to changing inputs or goals with minimal human input.
