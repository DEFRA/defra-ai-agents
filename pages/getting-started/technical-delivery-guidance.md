## 🛠️ 2.6. Technical & Delivery Guidance

This section provides practical guidance for designing, building, testing, and deploying AI agents, workflows, RPA bots, and multi-agent systems within Defra.

### 🧱 System Architecture Layers

Most intelligent systems can be broken down into four layers:

| Layer              | Description | Applies to |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Perception (Input)**  | Collects data from APIs, files, sensors, forms, or human input. | All system types |
| **Reasoning (Logic/Model)** | Encodes the rules, models, or goals that determine what the system decides. | AI Agents, AI Workflows, MAS |
| **Action (Execution)**  | Performs actions: updates systems, sends alerts, triggers APIs, etc. | RPA, Agents, Workflows |
| **Feedback/Adaptation** | Captures outcomes or errors to enable learning or improve future responses. | AI Agents, MAS (optional in RPA/Workflows) |

> 💡 AI Agents and MAS should be designed with **feedback loops** to adapt based on performance or outcomes.

### 🛠️ Tool Selection & Integration

| Task / Goal                           | Recommended Tools / Stack |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| RPA for UI-based automation           | UiPath, Power Automate |
| Multi-step AI workflows               | LangGraph, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, AWS Step Functions |
| Agent development                     | Azure AI Studio (GPT via OpenAI), Claude Agents (via Bedrock), AutoGen |
| Integration with Defra systems        | RESTful APIs, Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Graph |
| Data pipelines                        | Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue, Pandas for transformation |

### ⚙️ Key Delivery Activities

#### ✅ 1. **Design for Governance from the Start**
- Define who is accountable (business owner, product owner)
- Create a deployment plan that includes fail-safes, monitoring, and oversight points

#### ✅ 2. **Test Models, Workflows, and Agents Thoroughly**
- Use real data in sandbox environments
- Define metrics (accuracy, latency, false positive rate, impact)
- Include human-in-the-loop testing for critical decisions

#### ✅ 3. **Secure and Document the Data Pipeline**
- Validate data quality, completeness, and bias before training or automation
- Use Defra data standards for consistency
- Store and version datasets and models for audit purposes

#### ✅ 4. **Deploy with Monitoring and Alerting**
- Log all actions by agents or bots (inputs, outputs, decisions)
- Set alerts for failures, thresholds breached, or unexpected behaviour
- Use dashboards to support live operations and oversight

#### ✅ 5. **Plan for Post-Deployment Learning or Iteration**
- Set regular review cycles for updating models, rules, or behaviours
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms (especially for internal tools)
- Maintain a change log for governance and improvement tracking

### 📊 Metrics to Track

| Metric Type      | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Performance**  | Accuracy, latency, coverage, error rate |
| **Impact**       | Time saved, decisions accelerated, consistency improvements |
| **Fairness**     | Outcome parity across demographics or regions |
| **Transparency** | % of decisions logged with justification; ATRS completed |
| **Safety**       | Number of errors detected; time to detect/respond to anomalies |

---

### 🔐 Security & Access Control

- Implement role-based access for dashboards, models, and workflows
- Encrypt sensitive inputs/outputs (e.g. personal or environmental data)
- Ensure audit logging is in place for any decisions affecting citizens or the environment
- Follow Defra and CDDO guidance on secure deployment and monitoring

### 🧠 Best Practices by System Type

| System Type          | Build & Delivery Tips |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **AI Agents**        | Use goal-driven design, clearly define perception/action boundaries, log decisions and actions. |
| **AI Workflows**     | Chain together decision points with checkpoints, use rule engines or ML models, design for auditability. |
| **Traditional RPA**  | Script simple, repeatable tasks. Avoid embedding business logic that changes often. Use error handling and dashboards. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Test agent roles independently, simulate interactions, define conflict resolution mechanisms. Monitor emergent behaviour. |
