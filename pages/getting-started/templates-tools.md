| **AWS (Amazon Lex, Bedrock Agents)** | Conversational and action-oriented agents | - [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) for building traditional chatbots with speech/text.<br>- [AWS Bedrock Agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) for LLM-based assistants integrating APIs, documents, and tools. |
| **Anthropic (Claude Agents)** | Safe, conversational agents and GUI automation | - [Building Effective Agents guide](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) <br> - [Claude Agents overview](https://www.anthropic.com/solutions/agents) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| **AWS (Amazon Bedrock, CodeWhisperer)** | Scalable agent architecture, integration with AWS services | Refer to AWS Bedrock and agent SDK docs; use MCP protocol with AWS.<br>â€¯*(See MCP protocol adoption)* |
| **Microsoft (Semantic Kernel, AutoGen)** | Workflow automation & .NET ecosystem integration | - Semantic Kernel supports prompt chaining, planners, and Azure integration <br> - AutoGen for simulation/coordination via multi-agent patterns |
| **OpenAI / ChatGPT** | General-purpose agents, API orchestration | Use Agents SDK with function calling and tool support (MCP adoption with Claude)  |
| **Google (Gemini agents)** | Conversational assistants & multimodal agents | Gemini to adopt MCP protocol and support rich interactions |

### ðŸ§  Platform Notes

- **Microsoft Azure AI Studio**: Ideal for Defra teams building **secure conversational agents**, copilots, or intelligent workflows. Offers integration with GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI, native support for Semantic Kernel, and enterprise policy controls.
- **AWS Bedrock + Lex**: AWS Lex suits traditional chatbot-style interactions. Bedrock Agents support modern LLM-based assistants using Claude or Amazon Titan, good for document Q&A, workflows, and conversational APIs.
- **OpenAI**: Strong support for natural language function calling and plug-and-play assistant APIs. Good generalist support for many AI agent use cases.
- **Anthropic Claude**: Focused on safe, helpful, and controllable AI agents, suitable for policy, language-heavy, and enterprise contexts.
