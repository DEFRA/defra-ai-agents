## 8. Example Use Cases

> **Note:** The following are example use cases to illustrate where AI Agents, Workflows, RPA, or Multi-Agent Systems *could* be applied within Defra contexts.  
> They are **not confirmations**

| Use Case                             | Tool                    | Why                                                                 |

### Emerging Interoperability Patterns (MCP & A2A)

| Use Case                             | Tool/Pattern           | Why                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated environmental assessment pipeline | Model Context Protocol (MCP) | An AI agent reviews a development proposal by retrieving geospatial data, invoking an environmental impact model, and generating a summary. Each tool and model is accessed via a standardised MCP interface to ensure modularity and traceability across platforms. |
| Agent collaboration for land negotiation | Agent-to-Agent (A2A) | One agent represents agricultural priorities, another biodiversity, and a third public safety. They exchange structured offers/responses to simulate and optimise trade-offs in a land management plan. |
