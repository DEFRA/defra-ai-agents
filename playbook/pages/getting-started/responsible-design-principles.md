## 2.5. Responsible Design Principles

All AI and automation systems within Defra must be designed and deployed in a way that is **safe, effective, responsible, explainable, and fair**.

---

### Safe

> “The system does not cause unintended harm.”

| Apply to | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|
| **All systems** | Conduct risk assessments before launch. Test under real-world conditions. Establish safety limits and fallback mechanisms. |
| **AI Agents** | Include boundaries on what the agent can do; implement safe interrupt/override capabilities. |
| **RPA** | Ensure bots fail safely e.g. log errors and notify users instead of continuing silently. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Define agent roles clearly; simulate emergent behaviour to test for instability or risk amplification. |

---

### Effective

> “The system achieves its intended purpose and adds value.”

| Apply to | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|
| **All systems** | Define success metrics aligned with Defra policy goals. Validate through pilots or staged rollouts. |
| **AI Workflows** | Measure process improvements (speed, accuracy, consistency) before and after implementation. |
| **AI Agents** | Continuously monitor for decision quality in real-world scenarios. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Validate that coordination adds value and doesn’t introduce unnecessary complexity. |

---

### Responsible

> “The system is used legally, ethically, and with human oversight.”

| Apply to | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|
| **All systems** | Assign a clear owner and accountable person. Complete a DPIA if personal data is used. |
| **AI Workflows** | Embed human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical decisions. |
| **RPA** | Avoid automating ethically sensitive tasks unless oversight is guaranteed. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Include escalation paths when agents disagree or outcomes are contested. |

---

### Explainable

> “Decisions and actions are understandable to users and stakeholders.”

| Apply to | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|
| **AI Agents** | Use interpretable models or summarise decision rationale using natural language. |
| **AI Workflows** | Maintain logs of every decision step and model output. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Log agent interactions, and provide a clear summary of final decisions. |
