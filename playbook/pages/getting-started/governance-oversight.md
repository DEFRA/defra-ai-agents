## ðŸ“‚ 2.7. Governance & Oversight

Strong governance is essential to ensure that AI, automation, and multi-agent systems deployed within Defra are **safe, lawful, ethical, transparent, and aligned with public values**.

This section aligns with the **UK Government AI Playbook** Stage 6: _Govern and Improve_, and the five cross-cutting principles:
**Safe, Effective, Responsible, Fair, and Explainable**.

### ðŸ§  Best Practice Tips

- Embed AI governance in agile delivery â€“ governance is not a final-stage checklist.
- Conduct **independent peer review** of all medium or high-risk use cases.
- Maintain a **register of AI, RPA, and agent-based systems** in use within your team or programme.
- Ensure every system has a **named accountable owner** who understands both its purpose and risk profile.
- Monitor **ethics and legal implications continuously**, not only at procurement or launch.
