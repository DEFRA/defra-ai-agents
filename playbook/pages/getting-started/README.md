## Getting Started

Welcome to the **Defra AI Agents Playbook**! This section will help you quickly understand how to use the playbook and begin your journey with AI Agents, AI Workflows, Multi-Agent Systems, and Traditional Automation (RPA) within Defra.

---

### 1. Understanding the Tools

Learn about the different types of AI and automation solutions:

- **AI Agents** – Autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act toward defined goals.
- **AI-Driven Workflows** – Automated processes enhanced by AI models and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.
- **Traditional RPA** – Scripted bots that automate repetitive tasks across existing systems.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – Multiple agents working collaboratively or competitively to solve complex, multi-domain problems.

See [Understanding the Tools](understanding-the-tools) for more details.

### 2. Initial Fit Checklist

Use a simple checklist to decide whether your use case is a good candidate for AI, RPA, or a combination. This ensures you're applying the right type of solution for the problem at hand.

See [Initial Fit Checklist](initial-fit-checklist).

### 3. Selecting the Right Approach

Understand how to choose between agents, workflows, RPA, or multi-agent systems based on your task complexity, risk, and decision environment.

See [Selecting the Right Approach](right-approach).

---

### 4. AI System Selection Checklists

Use our detailed checklists to match your use case to the best system type. These help you identify whether you need an:

- AI Agent  
- AI Workflow  
- Traditional RPA Bot  
- Multi-Agent System  

See [AI System Selection Checklists](ai-checklist).

### 5. Responsible Design Principles

Follow the UK Government’s principles for building AI that is safe, effective, fair, explainable, and responsible from the outset.

See [Responsible Design Principles](responsible-design-principles).

---

### 6. Technical & Delivery Guidance

Practical advice for designing, building, and deploying AI and automation systems in Defra. Includes potential tools and technology stacks.

See [Technical & Delivery Guidance](technical-delivery-guidance).

---

### 7. Governance & Oversight

Understand the governance, compliance, and accountability requirements that apply to AI and automation projects. Includes links to government standards and internal artefacts.

See [Governance & Oversight](governance-oversight).

---

### 8. Templates & Tools

Access reusable templates, checklists, and frameworks to accelerate project delivery and support responsible design.

See [Templates & Tools](templates-tools).
