## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **Defra AI Agents Playbook**! This section will help you quickly understand how to use the playbook and begin your journey with AI Agents, AI Workflows, Multi-Agent Systems, and Traditional Automation (RPA) within Defra.

---

### 1. Understanding the Tools

Learn about the different types of AI and automation solutions:

- 🤖 **AI Agents** – Autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act toward defined goals.
- 🔁 **AI-Driven Workflows** – Automated processes enhanced by AI models and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.
- 🤖 **Traditional RPA** – Scripted bots that automate repetitive tasks across existing systems.
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Systems** – Multiple agents working collaboratively or competitively to solve complex, multi-domain problems.

📖 See [Understanding the Tools](understanding-the-tools) for more details.

### 2. Initial Fit Checklist

Use a simple checklist to decide whether your use case is a good candidate for AI, RPA, or a combination. This ensures you're applying the right type of solution for the problem at hand.

📖 See [Initial Fit Checklist](initial-fit-checklist).

---

### 3. Selecting the Right Approach

Understand how to choose between agents, workflows, RPA, or multi-agent systems based on your task complexity, risk, and decision environment.

📖 See [Selecting the Right Approach](right-approach).

---

### 4. AI System Selection Checklists

Use our detailed checklists to match your use case to the best system type. These help you identify whether you need an:

- 🤖 AI Agent  
- 🔁 AI Workflow  
- 🤖 Traditional RPA Bot  
- 🤝 Multi-Agent System  

📖 See [AI System Selection Checklists](ai-checklist).
