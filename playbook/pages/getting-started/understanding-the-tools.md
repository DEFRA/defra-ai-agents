## 2.1. Understanding the Tools

> **Note:** Any example use cases are to illustrate where AI Agents, Workflows, RPA, or Multi-Agent Systems *could* be applied within Defra contexts.  
> They are **not confirmations**


| Tool | Description | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **AI Agent** | An autonomous system that makes decisions or performs tasks based on goals and context. | When you need a system that can make dynamic decisions, respond to changing environments, and act independently. | **Smart thermostat**: Adjusts temperature based on preferences, weather, and occupancy without human input. |
| **AI Workflow** | A structured sequence of AI-enabled tasks or models, often involving humans-in-the-loop. | When the process is repetitive, rule-based, or model-driven but doesn’t require autonomy. | **Email spam filter**: Emails are scanned by an AI model and flagged, with final decisions made by the user. |
| **Traditional Automation (RPA)** | Scripted robots that mimic human actions in user interfaces. | When the task is repetitive, rule-based, and requires no intelligence or adaptation. | A bot that logs into a website and extracts reports every morning. |
| **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** | A group of AI agents that collaborate, negotiate or compete to achieve shared or individual goals. | When problems are decentralised, involve complex coordination, or need different agents with specific roles. | **Autonomous delivery drones**: Multiple drones coordinate routes and tasks to deliver packages efficiently. |
