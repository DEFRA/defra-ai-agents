## 2.9. Interoperability Standards: MCP & A2A

Emerging industry standards now enable **secure, modular, and scalable AI agent ecosystems** by promoting compatibility across tools, platforms, and agents.

This section introduces two key open specifications that Defra teams should be aware of when designing future-proof and collaborative AI systems.

> **Note:** Any example use cases are to illustrate where Interoperability Standards *could* be applied within Defra contexts.  
> They are **not confirmations**

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how AI agents, tools, and models exchange structured context, capabilities, and results.

[Visit official site](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

#### Why it matters

- Promotes **vendor-neutral interoperability** across models (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, Microsoft)
- Enables **modular agent architectures** with swappable models and tools
- Improves **auditability and security** by standardising tool definitions and execution flows

#### Example use in Defra

- An AI permitting agent uses MCP to securely access an environmental dataset, call a calculation tool, and summarise results for review
- Future-proofing Defra agents to interact with any government-approved LLM (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

#### Best practice

- Prefer or support MCP-compatible models and tools
- Use tool definitions, input/output schemas, and context state as per MCP spec
- Align internal APIs to be easily wrapped with MCP adapters

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Interoperability

**Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** is a new open standard and interaction pattern for **multi-agent collaboration**, announced by Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and others.

[Read the announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)

#### Why it matters

- Enables agents from different organisations or vendors to **collaborate securely**
- Uses **message passing** protocols and shared schemas for structured communication
- Supports **multi-agent systems** like simulation, negotiation, and decision delegation

#### Example use in Defra

- A planning agent and biodiversity agent exchange structured messages to negotiate trade-offs in land use planning
- Agents representing different regulatory bodies (e.g. water, air, food) simulate policy impacts collaboratively

#### Best practice

- Define agent roles with clear message formats (e.g. JSON schema)
- Implement A2A-style negotiation flows (e.g. propose, respond, revise)
- Log all A2A interactions for transparency and auditing

### Alignment with UK Government AI Playbook

| Principle / Stage     | How MCP & A2A Support It |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Modularity**         | Agents and tools become swappable, composable, and scalable |
| **Explainability**     | Standardised context and message logging improves traceability |
| **Safe & Responsible** | Supports permissioning, secure tool use, and version control |
| **Stage 5: Deploy**    | Enables integrated agent ecosystems across platforms |
| **Stage 6: Govern**    | Logs and schemas simplify oversight, transparency, and compliance |


### Summary

| Standard | Purpose | Use It When |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **MCP** | Standard interface for model/tool interactions | You’re calling LLMs or external tools from agents |
| **A2A** | Standard messaging protocol between agents | You’re coordinating across domains or roles using multiple agents |
