# Defra AI Agent Playbook
Version 0.1

## Purpose of this Playbook

This playbook is a living document that provides practical guidance on evaluating, designing, and deploying **AI Agents**, **AI Workflows**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, and **Traditional Automation (RPA)** within Defra. It is tailored to Defra’s unique operational context and challenges, and aligns with the [UK Government AI Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government) to promote the safe, effective, and responsible use of AI in the public sector.


> **Note:** All examples provided in this playbook are **illustrative** and intended to show **contextual possibilities only**.  
> They do **not** represent confirmation of existing systems or projects currently in use by Defra.



This playbook is designed to help Defra teams decide whether a use case is a good fit for:

- **AI Agents** – autonomous systems that make decisions or take actions in pursuit of defined goals, often adapting to real-time inputs and environmental context.

- **AI-Driven Workflows** – orchestrated sequences of rules, models, and tasks, typically including human-in-the-loop review and strong auditability.

- **Traditional Automation (RPA)** – scripted bots that automate repetitive, rule-based tasks, usually via user interfaces (e.g. form filling, copying data between systems).

- **Multi-Agent Systems** – a group of coordinated AI agents (or components) that interact to achieve shared or individual objectives, often across domains or roles.

It provides practical guidance to assess, design, and implement AI responsibly in line with the **UK Government AI Playbook** principles: **Safe**, **Effective**, **Responsible**, **Explainable**, and **Fair**.

## Overview

Defra manages environmental protection, food production and rural development across the UK. The department works through multiple sub-departments and arms-length bodies. Each has different roles and ways of working.

Defra's size and complexity create opportunities to use AI throughout software development. This playbook helps you use these opportunities through practical methods, tools and techniques.
